# Mailchimp Multichannel Campaign Wordpress RSS

## Scenario:

On my website [matthew.krupczak.org](https://matthew.krupczak.org) AKA [foobarbat.org](http://foobarbat.org):
* I would like to make it so that readers can sign up to be notified of new posts via email on the Homepage or at the bottom of any post
* An email should be sent out to the reader daily if new posts are created
* The email should contain a list of the posts created since they were last notified, along with the HTML content of the latest post in the body of the email
* The campaign should auto populate to Twitter as well
